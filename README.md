## Variable and Comparison Operators

Task 1
Assign a variable with each datatypes covered in the
previous workshop
The datatypes previous covered were “Boolean”, “String”, “Int”


Task 2
List all variables currently loaded in to memory.
The noun within the cmdlet is “Variable”


Task 3
Multiple two Int variables together
PowerShell can perform basic maths operators, such as “+”, “-“ and “*”


Task 4
First declare two Int variables. Then divided the first
variable by the second and assign the result to a
variable named $VariableResult
The easiest way to do this is within the Integrated Scripting Environment
(ISE) using multiple lines of code




Task 5
Typecast a Variable as a “String” and assign it a value
of 5
Remember to normal brackets [] rather than curly brackets {} when
typecasting a variable
