Task 4
First declare two Int variables. Then divided the first
variable by the second and assign the result to a
variable named $VariableResult
The easiest way to do this is within the Integrated Scripting Environment
(ISE) using multiple lines of code

Task 5
Typecast a Variable as a “String” and assign it a value
of 5
Remember to normal brackets [] rather than curly brackets {} when
typecasting a variable
